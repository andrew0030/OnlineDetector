**Online Detector** is a Mod that was made to help manage machinery and or **Redstone** contraptions on servers. The Mod adds a new Block Called Online Detector and an advanced version of it, that comes with a GUI in which you can choose the player you want it to be bound to. The intended use of the Mod is on servers, as the purpose of the Online Detector Block is to output a **Redstone** signal while the Player its bound to is online.

**A:** Yes absolutely! Feel free to use my Mods in your Modpacks.

**Q:** Can you update the Mod to version \[x\]

**Q:** Can you backport the Mod to version \[x\]
